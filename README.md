# Decision Tree Implementation using a Titanic Dataset
A decision tree was implemented to predict the survival rate of passengers using the Titanic dataset. Feature Selection and Data Cleaning was peroformed and can be viewed on the Decision Tree Assignment.ipynb file. To achieve Accuracy both Grid-Search CV and Pruning were performed.The results for this dataset showed that Grid-Search CV & pruning provide more or less the same accuracy. The File_4_Doc.py file contains the overview of the code and can be used to get a brief understanding. The dataset also has been uploaded for future refrence.
